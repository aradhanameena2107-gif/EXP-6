AIM: Study of conditional statemens in python

THEORY:

Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on given conditions. They allow a program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.
Python mainly uses if, elif, and else statements for decision-making.



1. if Statement

The if statement checks a condition and executes the block of code only if the condition is true.
Example use cases in this experiment include checking whether a number is positive, even, or a leap year.

2. if–else Statement

The if–else structure provides two paths of execution—one when the condition is true and another when it is false.

3. if–elif–else Ladder

The elif (else if) statement is used when multiple conditions need to be checked sequentially.

4. Relational and Logical Operators

Relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==) and logical operators (and, or, not) are used to form conditions.

5. User Input and Output

The input() function is used to take data from the user, and print() is used to display the results. Type conversion functions like int() and float() ensure correct calculations.
